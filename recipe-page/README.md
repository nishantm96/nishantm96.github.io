### What I learned

- I learned the basics of setting up of HTML layout and CSS Flexbox and Grid. 
- I also learned how to import fonts using files in CSS.

- I learned how to space the list items from its list item markers and found useful resource -  [everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gap-after-the-list-marker](https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gap-after-the-list-marker)

- Another point is about border on tr elements. Needed to add the following block for table for border
to be visible.
  ```css
  table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
  }
  ```
