## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid for accordion transition
- CSS Media Query
- Javascript

### What I learned

- I learned about how to do accordion transition between open and close states using CSS grid (grid template rows property supports transition). I found this approach from [here](https://keithjgrant.com/posts/2023/04/transitioning-to-height-auto/).

- I learned about tabindex and making elements tabbable (not all elements are tabbable by default).
