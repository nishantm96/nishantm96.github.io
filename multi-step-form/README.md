## My process

### Built with

- CSS Media Query
- CSS Position
- Javascript

### What I learned

- Position CSS properties apply based on containing block for target element. For position fixed, it is usually the viewport / body but can change based on certain attributes. Read more [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block#identifying_the_containing_block)
- I learned about how to implement toggle switch from checkbox - [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp)
- In this project, implementing mobile design first was easier and then media query to replace design changes for desktop.
